[dedication]
Dedication
----------
The optional dedication goes here.

This document is an AsciiDoc multi-part book skeleton containing
briefly annotated element placeholders plus a couple of example index
entries and footnotes. Books are normally used to generate DocBook
markup and the preface, appendix, bibliography, glossary and index
section titles are significant ('specialsections').

NOTE: Multi-part books differ from all other AsciiDoc document formats
in that top level sections (dedication, preface, book parts,
appendices, bibliography, glossary, index) must be level zero headings
(not level one).


[preface]
Example Preface
---------------
The optional book preface goes here at section level zero.

Preface Sub-section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: Preface and appendix subsections start out of sequence at level
2 (level 1 is skipped). This only applies to multi-part book
documents.
